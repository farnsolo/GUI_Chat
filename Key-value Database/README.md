## About
The Key-value Database stores Server name - IP pair values <br />
The database is designed to emulate the functions of a Domain Name Server <br />
The goal is to have real-time list of online servers from which the user can connect to. <br />
The user should also be able to create up to 5 servers from their IP address <br />




## Future changes:
- Implement into MAIN GUI_Chat files
- Store data in written files
- Write and read data from written file
- Use more scalable data structure - perhaps use dnspython for this
- Make more elegant network implementation
- More features to manage database
- Relational database for user info
